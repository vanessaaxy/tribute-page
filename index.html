          <h3><a href="https://www.esbnyc.com/"></a>Empire State Building</h3> <!--links don't work-->
          <p class="border">This is the Empire State Building. I didn't actually go up because I'm not that touristy, but I enjoyed looking it from the bottom. When I took this picture, I was wondering how I could take it to make it good. I also wondered if the view up there would have made a better picture. Probably. Probably not. There would be too many tourists. And I knew I wouldn't like that. <br>
            <br> The Empire State Buidling is an American cultural icon. Did you know that it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film King Kong was released in 1933? A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior have been designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and were confirmed as such by the New York City Board of Estimate. It was also designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, and was ranked number one on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d6413161-Reviews-Friends_Building-New_York_City_New_York.html"></a>Friends Building</h3>
          <p class="border">Oh, friends. My favourite TV series ever. I think I've watched all 10 seasons over 4 times now. It's crazy, but it just never gets old. <br>
          <br> Seeing this building was so nostalgic for me. So, of course, I had to take a picture that would do the place justice. And I hope I did. There were so many tourists when I came. All taking photos of the same thing. But this is one tourist spot I wouldn't mind hustling with the others for. <br>
          <br> I know it sounds a little insane, but honestly, the first thing that New York City reminds me of is friends. Not the Empire State Building, nor the Statue of Liberty. Friends. It's just such an icon! Or maybe it's just something real close to my heart. Just thinking about Rachel and Phoebe going to the movies in the yellow nyc cab; Chandler and Joey getting two boxes full of pizza; Monica and Ross having their parents over for dinner in this very apartment building... makes me want to watch the series all over again!</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.artichokepizza.com/"></a>Dinner at sunset</h3>
          <p class="border">This was such a sight.<br>
          <br> This pizza was a slice from Artichoke Basille's Pizza. I got their famous Artichoke pizza because I heard and saw all the good reviews about it. When the pizza guy first handed the slice over to me, I was so surprised! What a huge slice. Thank goodness I had a friend to share it with me. <br>
          <br> Then we headed over from the shop to the High Line, got ourselves a spot that featured this beautiful view. The sunset skies in New York city are just simply glorious. I love beautiful skies and I've never seen one like this back home in Singapore. I think it has to do with how the buildings in NYC tend to be shorter than those in Singapore, allowing for this almost unobstructed view of the sunset. <br>
          <br> It was a really great dinner, and I would love to have the experience again!</p>
